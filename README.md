# styles.wiki

✨ **styles.wiki** ✨ is a community-driven collection of styleguide rules for
various technical domains. "Styles" are submitted as GitHub issues and will
automagically appear in the web app using [Incremental Static Generation][isr].

[isr]: https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-5#stable-incremental-static-regeneration

Use this repo to submit issues for \*.styles.wiki.

## Current wikis:

- [**techwriting.styles.wiki**](https://techwriting.styles.wiki/) is for technical writing - project documentation, scoping docs, tech specs, RFCs etc.

## Call for help!

- I'm pretty terrible at design, and colour blind to boot. If you're handy with design, I'd love any help/suggestions I can get :)
- Is there a feature you think that would work well on styles.wiki? Maybe a better way to browse through styles, or an RSS feed? [Let me know](https://github.com/styles-wiki/styles-wiki/issues)!
